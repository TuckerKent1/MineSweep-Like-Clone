Random projects completed for my class work

This was done as a class project for my Java I class. It is a clone of the classic game.

At the time we only coded for console/terminal so there is no GUI. 

The game was created using and manipulating a multidimensional array, so the code can be rather confusing -- following the correct array.
I used one for the mines and the other for the display. Follow the comments.

It is fully functional -- have a go at it.
